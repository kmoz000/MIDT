# Master Plan for Secure Medical Records System

## Overview
This document outlines the detailed implementation plan for the Secure Medical Records System. The system ensures the secure storage, access, and management of medical records using blockchain technology, IPFS, and role-based access control.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain Platform**: Solana
- **Storage**: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solana Smart Contracts
- **Access Control**: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using badges
- **Encryption**: AES-256 for encrypting medical records
- **Secure Viewing**: Secure Enclaves or Secure Viewing Platforms

## Detailed Plan

### 1. Encrypt Medical Records
- **Objective**: Encrypt medical records to ensure data privacy.
- **Technology**: AES-256 encryption.
- **Steps**:
  1. Use AES-256 to encrypt medical records.
  2. Store the encryption key securely.

### 2. Store Encrypted Records in IPFS
- **Objective**: Store encrypted medical records in a decentralized storage system.
- **Technology**: IPFS.
- **Steps**:
  1. Upload encrypted medical records to IPFS.
  2. Obtain the Content Identifier (CID) for the stored records.

### 3. Link IPFS CID to Solana's NFT Standard
- **Objective**: Link the IPFS CID to a Solana NFT to ensure ownership and traceability.
- **Technology**: Solana NFTs.
- **Steps**:
  1. Create an NFT on Solana.
  2. Embed the IPFS CID in the NFT metadata.

### 4. Role-Based Access via Badges
- **Objective**: Implement role-based access control using badges.
- **Technology**: Solana Smart Contracts.
- **Steps**:
  1. Define roles (e.g., Verified Medical Institute, Patient).
  2. Assign badges to wallets via smart contracts.

### 5. Verify Role Before Access
- **Objective**: Ensure that only authorized roles can access the medical records.
- **Technology**: Solana Smart Contracts.
- **Steps**:
  1. Implement a smart contract to verify the role of the requester.
  2. Allow access only if the role is verified.

### 6. One-Time Access Mechanism
- **Objective**: Provide one-time access to medical records.
- **Technology**: Solana Smart Contracts.
- **Steps**:
  1. Medical institute requests access.
  2. Token holder approves access via smart contract.
  3. Generate a one-time decryption key.
  4. Enforce access rules using a custom viewer.

### 7. Embedded Access Logs
- **Objective**: Maintain logs of access actions.
- **Technology**: IPFS, Solana.
- **Steps**:
  1. Embed access logs in file metadata.
  2. Log view, modify, and transfer actions.
  3. Sign logs cryptographically.
  4. Update file CID after log append.

### 8. Privacy and Accountability
- **Objective**: Ensure privacy and accountability in accessing medical records.
- **Technology**: Secure Enclaves, On-Chain/Off-Chain Logs.
- **Steps**:
  1. Control decryption in secure environments.
  2. Use secure viewing platforms or secure enclaves.
  3. Maintain immutable logs on-chain or off-chain.

### 9. Challenges and Solutions
- **Objective**: Address potential challenges in the system.
- **Technology**: Solana Smart Contracts.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify challenges (e.g., badge spoofing).
  2. Implement solutions (e.g., verify roles on-chain).
